# Find your Github Repository

Tried building a github clone with the ability for a user to get their first 20 repositories displayed.
The project started cos I wanted to reeplicate Github UI with pure CSS (and after achieving that), I thought to include other functionalities like searching for user repositories.
For the fun of it, I decided to use React and Redux toolkit instead of the context API since this is majorly a simple project.
In the nearest future, I might decide to work completely with github OAUTH and include an authentication with many other functionalites as.
